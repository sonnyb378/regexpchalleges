## Regular Expression Challenge Project

This is a personal project aimed at improving my understanding of regular expression patterns in GoLang. The project consists of a set of challenges, categorized into different difficulty levels: easy, intermediate, and hard. The challenges are located in the `/problems` folder, and each difficulty level has its own subfolder.

## What I've Learned

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights and knowledge in the following areas:

- Regular expression patterns and their applications in GoLang.
- Creating custom error handling.
- Adding methods to structs.
- Implementing globally declared custom structs.
- String manipulation and `for...loops` in Golang.
- Understanding runes
